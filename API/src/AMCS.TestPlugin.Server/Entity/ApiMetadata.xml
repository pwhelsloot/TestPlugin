  This file defines metadata for the REST API's. The information below describes
  metadata that's missing from the ORM layer.
  
  Once we get to rebuilding the ELEMOS ORM layer, the information below will be
  integrated into the new ORM layer, obviating the need for this file.
  
  The Context element is used to define groups in the API. You can e.g. bind
  a number of entities into a specific route, creating logical groups for them.
  To remove redundancy in the type declarations, Context requires a Namespace
  and Assembly attribute. The qualified types for the entities are created from
  those.
  
  Routes can be reused for different contexts. If entities live in different
  namespaces or assemblies, but need to be in the same context (i.e. route),
  define two contexts with the same route and different namespaces/assemblies.
